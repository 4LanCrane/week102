/**
 * Challenge lab
 * 
 * Create a generic class TrustyGarage<X> (where X will be Bike, Car etc)
 * and move the HashMap, stocknumber and add code from TrustyBikes into it (inserting
 * the type variable X as appropriate).
 * 
 * Then change TrustyBikes to extend TrustyGarage<Bike>, and check that 
 * TrustyBikesApp still works.
 * 
 * If you wish, modify TrustyCars to extend TrusyGarage<Car> in the same way (you
 * will need to modify TrustyCarsApp as well)
 * 
 * See how we can use a generic type to share functionality between the garages, 
 * while keeping their own types quite distinct from each other.
